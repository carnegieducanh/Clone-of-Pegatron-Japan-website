                                    Some of these minerals might be involved in
                                    the supply chains of the electronics
                                    industry. To address this issue, PEGATRON
                                    initiated a project for investigating
                                    conflict minerals in 2012. PEGATRON
                                    encourages our suppliers to transparently
                                    disclose the conflict minerals and cobalt
                                    containing in their products and components
                                    in accordance with the OECD Guidance. We
                                    expect our suppliers to cooperate in
                                    providing the report of smelters information
                                    with the Conflict Minerals Reporting
                                    Template (CMRT) of gold, tin, tungsten, and
                                    tantalum and Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT)
                                    of cobalt in our supplier chain.
                                    Furthermore, PEGATRON does not prohibit
                                    conflict-free minerals, including cobalt,
                                    from the Democratic Republic of Congo and
                                    neighboring regions. We actively promote the
                                    use of RMI Compliant Smelter & Refiner Lists
                                    in our supply chain, encouraging smelters to
                                    participate in the Responsible Minerals
                                    Assurance Process (RMAP; formerly the CFSP).
                                    We uphold international human rights
                                    standards and closely monitor this issue to
                                    uphold our commitment to the Responsible
